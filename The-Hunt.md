# **Confirmed Relations** <a name="confirmedrelations"></a>

* Book of Lorath mentions Wirt's leg, "a bell bearing his name", and Ahduma the Earthbreaker.
* Datamined objects with "Quest_World_SecretCellar" attribute.
* Herds of Aurochs, now extinct, used to roam the "Northern Steppes".
* Well in Dry Steppes, Ked Bardu (northeast of town portal) with the following inscription: _"The Oxen Gods stand as guardians to this sacred fountain. It is said that one who presents a worthy offering cleansed in these waters may receive their blessing."_
    * _Within the fountain is a stone ‚ÄúThe crumbling stone has a few discernable words: ‚Äú...spill their blood to be deemed worthy‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äù_

# **Rumors** <a name="rumors"></a>

* Book of Lorath (see long form reference below) "... but perhaps there is such pasture in the Burning Hells." Possible reference to accessing cow level from Helltide or acquiring items from those events in certain areas.
* The Northern Steppes Auroch herds rumored hunted to extinction by barbarians. Possibly barbarian related item to be found (Dry Steppes Crane Tribe, Dry Steppes Oxen Tribe, Fractured Peaks Bear Tribe).
* Monarch spirit shield model (coveted d2 item found from cow level) on floor of dungeon "shadowed plunge" /  also the First Floor of that Dungeon is called "Hall of Sacrifices"
* In the Dungeon "Sanguine Shrines" there is Drop called "Bill of Mortality"

    Bill of Mortality: In the year of the Light 1318 Anno Kehjistani, we have buried 92 souls on these hallowed grounds.


    Abortive and Stillborn: 7. Bleeding Wounds: 4. Childbed: 2. Executed: 15. Frostbitten: 6. Old Age: 1. Removal of Blood: 54. Starvation: 3.


    _Could be a code, could be related to something else, could be nothing. Anyone got an Idea to solve it?_

* A questline ‚ÄúCrucible of Worth‚Äù in Ked Bardu rewards a named rare ‚ÄúRaekor‚Äôs Valor‚Äù with a description that reads: \
‚Äú_Famed Oxen Tribe ancestral weapon wielded by Warmaster Raekor. It is stained with the blood of demons from Mt. Arreat._‚Äù
    * Could be related to the ‚Äúworthy offering‚Äù that needs to be cleansed the Oxen statue is hinting at?
    * Tried dropping it on the floor inside the fountain and nothing happened.

**Wirt's Leg**

_"This Relic does not refer to the poor lad's original Leg, the bones of which were found with Bishibosh, the great Shaman of the Fallen. Instead, I write of the wooden peg attached to the stump of his leg by Old Tristram's healer, Pepin. According to one piece of improbable lore, **Wirt died when a rampaging herd of possessed cattle trampled him into the mud**, and this event imbued his wooden peg with very specific magical properties. In a manner similar to **the bell bearing his name**, **Wirt's Leg is said to grant access to a demonic plane** where vengeance can be visited upon a herd of cursed demonic cattle, including their infernal king. I find these claims only slightly more credible than those for the previous Wirt relic. It is well known that demonic forces can easily drive horses, cattle, and camels to stampede. There is also the **mythic figure of Ahduma the Earthbreaker[1], a terrifying aurochs ([Image of an Auroch)](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Aurochs?file=Aurochs.png)** named in ancient tales. Because of this, it is possible that Wirt died in the way the stories claim. I am unconvinced the lad's leg can open a portal to a cattle realm, **but perhaps there is such pasture in the Burning Hells."**_


    **_[1] Ahduma the Earthbreaker was an aurochs, and the queen of her kind. She had the ability to breathe fire from her nostrils, which was said to be able to thaw the Frozen Sea. Early in Sanctuary's history, during the time of the Ancients, a quartet of nephalem hunters entered the Northern Steppes and separated an aurochs from its herd. Ahduma came to its rescue. Shrugging off the attacks of the hunters, she slew one of them. After giving the cornered aurochs time to flee, she gave a snort over the nephalem‚Äôs corpse, then returned to her herd.The aurochs were as large as caravan wagons; and only slightly shorter than a nephalem. They had broad horns and iron hooves. They moved in herds across the Northern Steppes, and their queen was Ahduma._**


    _The reason for the aurochs' extinction is unclear, but some believe they were hunted to extinction by the Barbarians, who wore the aurochs' shaggy coats and grew large and powerful on their flesh.[1]_

# **_Datamined Items:_** <a name="datamine"></a>

_[Bloody Wooden Shard] (likely Wirt's Leg remnant)_

_"A worn, bloodstained chunk of wood with tattered leather straps. The letter "W" has been crudely carved on one side. Though its purpose is lost to time, this was once an object of great significance."_

_[Musty Tome] (likely tome of town portal)_

_"The tattered leather binding of an old tome. The deep blue dye has faded with age, and all of the pages have been torn out. Though its purpose is lost to time, this was once an object of great significance."_

_[Intricate Metallic Fragment] (Horadric cube? Need context) - Matches texture from scattered prism. Likely world boss drop?_

_"A metallic fragment of unknown origin, still humming with magical energies. It appears to be part of some ancient device. Though its purpose is lost to time, this was once an object of great significance."_

_[Strange Key] (possibly new to Diablo IV, item relevant by attribute "Quest_World_SecretCellar" and association)_

_"A large metal key. Though it appears ordinary, you feel that it has some kind of power. Who knows what this could unlock?"_

# Screenshots of Cow Locations: <a name="screenshots"></a>

In General: If a spot on the map looks like a field, the chances are very high there are cows there.

**Wirt's Bell and Squirt the Peddler**

_"**Squirt the Peddler** is an NPC in Act II of Diablo III. Most notably, **she sells Wirt's Bell**, as well as some high-level recipes, including those for Hellfire Rings and Hellfire Amulets. As of patch 2.3, she also sells gem essences for Kanai's Cube gem transmutations._

**_Originally she was standing near the fountain next to a cart on Caldeum Bazaar. After Patch 1.0.4, Squirt had heard that many people bought potions at the Hidden Camp, so she moved up there. As of patch 1.0.6, Squirt the Peddler has also been found just NE of the waypoint in the hidden camp, and is the best vendor to sell all the trash acquired in Act II to."_**
